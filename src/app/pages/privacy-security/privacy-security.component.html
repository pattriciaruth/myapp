  <h1>Privacy &amp; Security</h1>

  <p>
    This inventory app was built for learning purposes in PROG2005. It does not
    use any backend or database. All data is stored
    <strong>in memory only</strong> while the page is open.
  </p>

  <h2>Data storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Items are kept in an in-memory TypeScript array inside an Angular
      service.
    </li>
    <li>When the page is refreshed or closed, all inventory data is lost.</li>
    <li>No information is sent to a server or external API.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Input validation &amp; safety</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Required fields are checked before items are added.</li>
    <li>
      Numeric values such as quantity, price and stock level are restricted to
      sensible ranges.
    </li>
    <li>
      Angular templates automatically escape text when it is displayed, which
      helps reduce simple cross-site scripting risks.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Personal data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The system tracks products only. It does not store user accounts,
      passwords or customer details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because there is no login and no persistent storage, the privacy risks
      are very low.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In a real production system, a secure backend, authentication, HTTPS and
    stronger server-side validation would be required. For this assignment,
    client-side TypeScript and Angular validation are sufficient.
